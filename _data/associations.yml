  summary: It seems as if every HP 3000 site has a Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) story. For example, consider this discussion thread from the 3000-L; I'd like to get some ideas/info on how others solved the 'access to the spool file' SOX issue. My current aggravation with the auditors is as follows; We have a snag in our production data, and I have to run JCL jobs in production to try to find the hosed data. To run these research JCL's, I have to use my logon with BA access in the job card of the JCL so that if I try to change the production data using these JCL's while doing research, my user will be tracked in the log files for the changes...geeez
